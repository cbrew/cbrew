- I'm Chris Brew
- I’m interested in the science and engineering of computational linguistics and NLP.
- I’m currently learning about the law, as part of my work as a data scientist at Lexis Nexis 
- Lexis Nexis, like everyone, is evaluating ChatGPT and GPT3.5. I am the data science lead on the case law summarization part of this evaluation.
